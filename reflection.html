            <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
            <p> Responsive design is web design with the goal to make website render well no matter the platform used to surf it with. This can be making sure you website fits on screens that are smaller such as phone and tablets and bigger screen such as your computer monitor. The website should have no issue working on big screens such as your computer monitor or even bigger a big screen tv. What I learn about responsive design in css you can make a webpage fit on a big screen, medium screen, or a small using some css using the @media screen using this keyword you can set the web page to media so if it a big screen it can have three columns if it a small screen it can one colum and it a medium screen it can have two columns</p>
            <h2>grid</h2>
            <p>Grid allows you to make a responsive design by allowing you to change the size of divs based on the screen size if the screen is small the box will be smaller for example you can design an with grid  template colum of 3fr 2fr and 1fr the div that is three will be 3 time the size of  1 fr and the 3/2 the size of 2fr this useful because you can make divs that fit any screen with out responsive design the size of the div will be set in stone let say you make the div 320 pixels it will always be 320 pixel and it will look small on big screens or it will look large on small screens. This is problem because the information may not fit on the screen and the user will have to scroll to see it, or on big screens the user will have to zoom in to see the information</p>
            <h2>flex box</h2>
            <p> box is grid but smarter it will adapt to the screen a hard rule that adjust to the screen may not work because the ratios are just wrong flex box will adapt to the screen and is more smart this allows you to better make app because you are doing less work to adapt each specific phone</p>
            <h2>difference between flex box, grid, and @media</h2>
            <p>media queries you have plan ahead and make it for each phone this is the best because if you design it for each device it will work each device the problem with unique designs is that you have to make them for each device or it may not look the best. Grid is an evolution of @media it will adapt to the screen but the rules are hards rules and it may not work for every device. Flex box is will work on any device but it constantly getting upgrade and the difference is automatic not a hard rule.</p>
            <h2>Thoughts on the course</h2>
            <p>How did I like this course. It taught me a lot about web development  I learned how to use javascript to modify pages dynamically I learned how to use html to make a web page. And I love learning css to make a web page look cool. I learned a lot and I like having a teacher that can workshop problems with me </p>
